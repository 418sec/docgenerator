3. Themes
===

docgenerator provides some themes by default.

These themes are:

- default

However, it also provides you a way to define your own themes.

When setting the theme, use a string like `custom:path/to/theme`. Example:

    generator
        .set( 'theme', 'custom:themes/mytheme' )
        .generate();

This code will look in the `themes/mytheme` folder for CSS and JS files and add
them to the generated documentation. For convenience, these files are sorted
with the javascript `sort()` method.
