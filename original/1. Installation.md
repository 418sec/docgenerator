1. Installation
===

docgenerator requires a dependency before anything else:

- [markdown_py][1]: see [the instructions][2] to install on your platform.

Once you've installed it, you can:

    npm install docgenerator

This will create a `node_modules` folder, within which the docgenerator
module will live.
